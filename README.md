# INDIA-CENSUS-DATA-MANIPULATION-WITH-VISUALIZATION

INDIA 2021 CENSUS
I got this dataset from Kaggle.com, imported via pandas library, Assesed to know the structure and information about the dataset. There were no missing values when I checked with isnull() function. The target here was to asses the dataset with some the popular python functions. 


Here , I used the index function, added caption to the data frame. Filter by using groupby function, visualize with bar chat and  added prefix the to the  column headings.
